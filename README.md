# Anichann
This web application, built with the Next.js framework, relies on data fetched from the Consumet API.

## Features
The homepage displays top airing anime and recent episode releases.
Users have the option to search for anime titles.

## Content Guidelines
Anichann doesn't stores any data. It fetches it data through Consumet API which in turns scrapes other websites to get that stream. If you have any problem, then try contacting the owner of those websites.
